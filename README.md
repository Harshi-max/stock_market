# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# Stock Market Agent

This project is a full-stack application that includes a backend API built using **FastAPI** and a frontend built using **React**. The application allows users to retrieve stock information based on ticker symbols. The backend handles the stock data retrieval, while the frontend displays the information to the user.

## Project Overview

The application has two main parts:

- **Backend (API)**: A RESTful API built with FastAPI, providing endpoints to fetch stock information.
- **Frontend**: A React app that interacts with the backend API to display stock data to the user.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up both the frontend and backend portions of the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (for frontend)
- **Python 3.7+** (for backend)
- **pip** (for installing Python dependencies)

### Setting Up the Backend

1. Clone or download the repository.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd stock-market-agent



Navigate to the src folder to set up the backend.

bash
Copy
Edit
cd src
Install Python dependencies using pip.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the FastAPI server.

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload
Your backend will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can access the API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Backend API Endpoints
GET /
Returns a welcome message.

Example response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "message": "Welcome to the Stock Market API!"
}
GET /stock/{ticker}
Fetches stock data for the given ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL).

Example request:

http
Copy
Edit
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/stock/AAPL
Example response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "price": "Fetching...",
  "recommendation": "Pending analysis"
}
Setting Up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory.

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../frontend
Install Node.js dependencies.

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Run the React app.

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Your frontend will now be running at http://localhost:3000. The app will interact with the backend API to fetch and display stock data.

Running the Application Locally
Backend
The FastAPI server will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

You can test the API by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs for the interactive API documentation.

Frontend
The React app will be running at http://localhost:3000.

The frontend will make requests to the backend API to fetch and display stock data.

Deployment
Backend Deployment
You can deploy the backend on any cloud platform that supports Python. Some common platforms are:

Heroku:

Create a Procfile with the following content:

bash
Copy
Edit
web: uvicorn src.main:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=${PORT:-5000}
Deploy your app by pushing to a Heroku Git repository.

AWS:

Deploy the FastAPI app on AWS Lambda or EC2.

Use AWS API Gateway for routing HTTP requests to your FastAPI server.

Frontend Deployment
The frontend can be deployed on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

Netlify:

Push the frontend folder to a GitHub repository and connect it to Netlify for continuous deployment.

Vercel:

Similar to Netlify, push the frontend folder to GitHub and deploy using Vercel.

Testing
For local testing of the backend, run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload
This will start the FastAPI server with hot reloading. To test the frontend, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Both parts should work locally on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (for backend) and http://localhost:3000 (for frontend).

Challenges
API Integration: The stock data fetching functionality is a placeholder. You can integrate real-time stock data by connecting to APIs such as Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, or Yahoo Finance.

Stock Recommendations: The backend has a basic structure for stock recommendations, but logic for analyzing and suggesting stocks based on data will need to be implemented.

Additional Information
Frontend Tech Stack:

React

Axios (for API requests)

Backend Tech Stack:

FastAPI

Uvicorn (for serving the app)

Python 3.7+

Dependencies listed in requirements.txt

Deployment Platforms:

Backend: Heroku, AWS (EC2 or Lambda)

Frontend: Netlify, Vercel
